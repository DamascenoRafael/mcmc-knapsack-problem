## About

The objective of this repository is to establish solutions for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, that is, each element may or may not be in the solution without repetition. The developed code aims to evaluate the results and performance of different algorithms involving Markov Chains Monte Carlo. The techniques covered involved the algorithms of Random Walk, Metropolis Hastings, Simulated Annealing in different cooling and transition strategies in contrast to the pseudo-polynomial solution algorithm and also the greedy algorithm known as Hill Climbing. In addition, this repository seeks to raise the possible scenarios in which Markov Chain Monte Carlo have an advantage over the deterministic algorithms.
